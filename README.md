# Data-Science-projetcs
## Introduction

 This is my repo of various projects that i made to implement my Skills learning during my studies in Data Science. Here you will find topics like:
 * Coding in different Languages.
   
   Tipically Phyton, as this is the most implement language to solve datarelated issues.
* Machine Learning models.
  
  Focused on different matemathical and physical models. Although also topics such as finance, traffic flow and else.
* Data manipulation.

    As this is the basic of the ML-models, many projects here will have problem related to data structure and his solves.

## About me
  Im a physics graduate, this means that all my procedures have the cientific rigor demanded in theorical and experimental physics, just like my procedures, following these ideas i try to keep the explanation of te problem in a formal and accesible way to anyone.

 ## Comments

  Feel free to make any comment in the Issues section, i will be happy to discuss any of my ideas with everyone. Im here to collaborate and learn.
